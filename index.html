        <p>The Porters Clan is the best online family and community God blessed me with this year.
      Joining TPC is one of the best decisions I made this year. 
      It's been a fulfilling decision so far.
      One of the best highlights for me in TPC is how we are groomed to embrace our authentic self and be audacious in our different fields and career paths.
  
      Personally for me, I have been able to grow spiritually to know that the best foundation to build on and have a successful life as a student and as a person is JESUS CHRIST.

          Being in The Porters Clan has really transformed my mindset towards building online and helped my growth in that regard.
When I joined this amazing community, I was a complete newbie in the digital ecosystem so I didn't have a complete idea of what to expect. Almost everyday, I asked The MilliporterMaker, now my Chief Porter questions on how the community will run.

        My stay @TPC has been an incredible one indeed.
From the inception of the activities right up to the prayers and daily charge.
The sessions with the Porters are very enlightening and it's so nice to learn from different perspectives
The best activities on my side have been Wednesday meet with Chief. The way she dishes out the most simple ideas but yet, expands more in it is a delight.

          I have found great value in being part of Porter's clan. The community has been a source of inspiration and motivation for me, helping me to achieve my goals and become the person I want to be. Through my involvement in the community, I have gained confidence in myself and learned new things.
I have been exposed to new ideas and perspectives, and I have been challenged to think in different ways. I am grateful for the positive impact this community has had on me.
